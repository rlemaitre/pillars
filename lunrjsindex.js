See the [toc] for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. 🎉 And if you like the project, but just don&#8217;t have time to contribute, that&#8217;s fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about: Star the project Tweet about it Refer this project in your project&#8217;s readme Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues Code of Conduct This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Pillars Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to pillars@pillars.dev . I Have a Question If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation . Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first. If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following: Open an Issue . Provide as much context as you can about what you&#8217;re running into. Provide project and platform versions (scala, sbt, etc), depending on what seems relevant. We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible. I Want To Contribute When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license. Reporting Bugs Before Submitting a Bug Report A good bug report shouldn&#8217;t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible. Make sure that you are using the latest version. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation . If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section . To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker . Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue. Collect information about the bug: Stack trace (Traceback) OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant. Possibly your input and the output Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions? How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to security@pillars.dev . We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project: Open an Issue . (Since we can&#8217;t be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior. Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. Provide the information you collected in the previous section. Once it&#8217;s filed: The project team will label the issue accordingly. A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro . Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced. If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix , as well as possibly other tags (such as critical ), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone . Suggesting Enhancements This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Pillars, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality . Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before Submitting an Enhancement Make sure that you are using the latest version. Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration. Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It&#8217;s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project&#8217;s developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you&#8217;re just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library. How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Pillars users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

    "text": " Table of Contents Quick Start Installation Usage Application Metadata Quick Start This documentation needs to be written. You can help us by contributing to the documentation . Installation This library is currently available for Scala binary version 3.3.1. To use the latest version, include the following in your build.sbt : libraryDependencies ++= Seq( \"com.rlemaitre\" %% \"pillars-core\" % \"0.2.0\" ) You can also add optional modules to your dependencies: libraryDependencies ++= Seq( \"com.rlemaitre\" %% \"pillars-db\" % \"0.2.0\", \"com.rlemaitre\" %% \"pillars-db-migration\" % \"0.2.0\", \"com.rlemaitre\" %% \"pillars-flags\" % \"0.2.0\", \"com.rlemaitre\" %% \"pillars-http-client\" % \"0.2.0\" ) Usage You can find an example project in the modules/example directory. First, you need to create a configuration file . You can find an example in the modules/example/src/main/resources/application.conf file. Then, you can create your entry point by extending the EntryPoint trait: object app extends pillars.EntryPoint: // (1) def app: pillars.App[IO] = new: // (2) def infos: AppInfo = BuildInfo.toAppInfo // (3) def endpoints = Endpoints.all def run: Run[IO, IO[Unit]] = // (4) val controllers: List[Controller[IO]] = List(HomeController(), UserController()) for _ &lt;- Logger[IO].info(s\"📚 Welcome to ${Config[IO].name}!\") _ &lt;- DBMigration[IO].migrate(\"classpath:db-migrations\") // (5) _ &lt;- flag\"feature-1\".whenEnabled: DB[IO].use: session =&gt; for date &lt;- session.unique(sql\"select now()\".query(timestamptz)) _ &lt;- Logger[IO].info(s\"The current date is $date.\") yield () _ &lt;- HttpClient[IO].get(\"https://swapi.dev/api/people/1\"): response =&gt; for _ &lt;- Logger[IO].info(s\"Response: ${response.status}\") size &lt;- response.body.compile.count _ &lt;- Logger[IO].info(s\"Body: $size bytes\") yield () _ &lt;- ApiServer[IO].start(controllers.foldLeft(List.empty)(_ ++ _.endpoints)) yield () end for end run end app 1 The EntryPoint trait is a simple trait that provides a main method and initialize the Pillars instance. 2 The pillars.App[IO] must contain your application logic 3 infos defines some metadata about your application. It is used by the admin server to display information about your application. See 4 The run is the entry point of your application. Here, you have access to the Pillars instance. Then, you can run your application. For example, you can run it with sbt : sbt \"example/run\" The log should display something like: 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0000 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.Pillars.apply:52 - Loading modules... 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0001 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.Pillars.loadModules:87 - Found 2 module loaders: db, feature-flags 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0002 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.db.db.load:57 - Loading DB module 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0003 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.db.db.load:68 - DB module loaded 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0004 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.flags.FlagManager.load:54 - Loading Feature flags module 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0005 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.flags.FlagManager.load:57 - Feature flags module loaded 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0000 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.AdminServer.start:22 - Starting admin server on 0.0.0.0:19876 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0006 [io-comp...] [INFO ] example.app.run:24 - 📚 Welcome to Bookstore! 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0000 [io-comp...] [INFO ] example.app.run:29 - The current date is 2024-01-21T22:36:19.695572+01:00. 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0000 [io-comp...] [INFO ] pillars.ApiServer.init:21 - Starting API server on 0.0.0.0:9876 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0001 [io-comp...] [INFO ] org.http4s.netty.server.NettyServerBuilder - Using NIO EventLoopGroup 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0001 [io-comp...] [INFO ] org.http4s.netty.server.NettyServerBuilder - Using NIO EventLoopGroup 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0002 [io-comp...] [INFO ] org.http4s.netty.server.NettyServerBuilder - Started Http4s Netty Server at http://[::]:9876/ 2024.01.21 22:36:19:0002 [io-comp...] [INFO ] org.http4s.netty.server.NettyServerBuilder - Started Http4s Netty Server at http://[::]:19876/ You can now access the API at http://localhost:9876 and the admin server at http://localhost:19876 . For example, to get the readiness porbe status, you can run: $ curl http://localhost:19876/admin/probes/health | jq { \"status\": \"pass\", \"checks\": [ { \"componentId\": \"db\", \"componentType\": \"datastore\", \"status\": \"pass\" } ] } Application Metadata The infos property of the App[F] trait defines some metadata about your application. You have two ways of defining it: You can directly create an instance of AppInfo : val infos = AppInfo( name = App.Name(\"Bookstore\"), version = App.Version(\"1.0.0\"), description = App.Description(\"A simple bookstore\") ) Or, if you are using the sbt-buildinfo plugin, you can use the BuildInfo object. In your build.sbt , add the following lines to your project definition: lazy val example = Project(\"pillars-example\", file(\"modules/example\")) .enablePlugins(BuildInfoPlugin) // (1) .settings( name := \"pillars-example\", // (2) description := \"pillars-example is an example of application using pillars\", // (3) libraryDependencies ++= Dependencies.tests ++ Dependencies.migrationsRuntime, buildInfoKeys := Seq[BuildInfoKey](name, version, description), // (4) buildInfoOptions := Seq(BuildInfoOption.Traits(\"pillars.BuildInfo\")), // (5) buildInfoPackage := \"example.build\", // (6) publish / skip := true, libraryDependencySchemes += \"org.typelevel\" %% \"otel4s-core-trace\" % VersionScheme.Always ) .dependsOn(core, dbSkunk, flags, httpClient, dbMigrations) 1 Enable the BuildInfo plugin 2 Define the name of your application 3 Define the description of your application 4 Tell buildinfo to generate the BuildInfo object including at least name , description and version properties. In this specific case, version is defined by the sbt-dynver plugin. 5 Configure BuildInfo to implement the pillars.BuildInfo trait. It is required to use the BuildInfo object in your application. 6 Specify in which package will be generated the BuildInfo object. Then, you can use the BuildInfo object in your application: import example.build.BuildInfo val app = new App[IO]: override val infos = BuildInfo.toAppInfo override def run(pillars: Pillars[IO]): IO[Unit] = ???

Probes are used to determine if a container is ready to accept traffic or if it should be restarted. Liveness Probe A liveness probe checks if the container is still running. If the liveness probe fails, the container is restarted. Pillars defines a default liveness probe. Readiness Probe A readiness probe checks if the container is ready to accept traffic. If the readiness probe fails, the container is not added to the load balancer. The pillars readiness probe aggregates all probes defined in the application. Pillars defines by default a database probe that is enabled if you include the db module . Custom Probes You can define custom probes by implementing the Probe trait. trait Probe[F[_]]: def component: Component // (1) def check: F[Boolean] // (2) def config: ProbeConfig = ProbeConfig() // (3) end Probe 1 The probe component. 2 The check function. If the check function returns true , the probe is considered successful. If is returns false or throws an exception, the probe is considered failed. 3 The probe configuration. "

    "text": " Table of Contents Feature Flags module Creating a feature flag Using a feature flag Endpoints Feature Flags module Feature flags are a way to enable or disable features in your application. They are useful for many reasons, including: Allowing you to test features in production before releasing them to all users. Allowing you to do a gradual rollout of a feature to a percentage of users. Currently, feature flags are only read from the configuration file and cannot be changed at runtime. This means that you will need to restart your application to change the value of a feature flag. In the future, we plan to add support for changing feature flags at runtime and storing them in a database. Creating a feature flag Feature flags are defined in the feature-flags section of the configuration file. feature-flags: enabled: true # (1) flags: - name: feature-1 # (2) status: enabled # (3) - name: feature-2 status: disabled 1 Whether feature flags are enabled or not. If this is set to false , all feature flags will be disabled. 2 The name of the feature flag. 3 The status of the feature flag. Possible values are enabled and disabled .

Endpoints Feature flags are exposed on the admin server . Get all feature flags The GET /admin/flags endpoint returns all feature flags. curl -X GET http://localhost:19876/admin/flags The response is a JSON array of feature flags. [ { \"name\": \"feature-1\", \"status\": \"enabled\" }, { \"name\": \"feature-2\", \"status\": \"disabled\" } ] Get a specific feature flag The GET /admin/flags/+{name}+ endpoint returns a specific feature flag. curl -X GET http://localhost:19876/admin/flags/feature-1 The response is a JSON object with the name and status of the feature flag. { \"name\": \"feature-1\", \"status\": \"enabled\" } Update a specific feature flag The PUT /admin/flags/+{name}+ endpoint updates a specific feature flag. curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"status\": \"disabled\"}' http://localhost:19876/admin/flags/feature-1 The request body should be a JSON object with the new status of the feature flag. { \"status\": \"disabled\" } The response is a JSON object with the name and status of the feature flag. { \"name\": \"feature-1\", \"status\": \"disabled\" } "

Parameters are: log-after : (duration) the time after which the migration log will be printed. It must be declared in the ISO-8601 format. Default is PT5s (five seconds). See Dumbo for more information. validate-on-migrate : (boolean) whether to validate the schema after migration. db-migration: log-after: PT5s validate-on-migrate: true Usage In order to use the DB Migration module, you need to add it as a dependency to your project. The migrations are written in SQL and are located in the src/main/resources/db/migration directory of your project. The migration files must be named in the following format: V{version}__{description}.sql , where: {version} is the version of the migration, and {description} is a description of the migration. The migration files are executed in the order of their version. To execute the migrations, you can use the migrate method of the DBMigration[F] class. "
